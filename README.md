# Check-Yo-Self
### by Foster Taylor

Site built with Javascript, CSS, and HTML. This is my final solo project as a student in Mod1 at Turing School of Software and Design.  My focus on this site was to write semantic HTML with clean and organized CSS styles, as well as a strong focus on DRY Javascript.  An additional focus was placed on using local storage to persist data.

This site's focus is on building tasks and Todo lists for a User's daily life.  Each card and task item provides a user with ability to monitor tasks and prioritize certain tasks.  The site gives the user the ability to mark off tasks as they are completed.
